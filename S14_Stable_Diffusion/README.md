## Details:
    - To generate images through different styles using **Stable Diffusion** 
    - Huggingface diffusers library is used for the same.
    - Reference : https://github.com/fastai/diffusion-nbs/blob/master/Stable%20Diffusion%20Deep%20Dive.ipynb
    - 10 Different styles downloaded from https://huggingface.co/sd-concepts-library is used to
    generate images
    - Loss function calculates the pattern loss between the output image and the desired pattern.
    - The desired pattern that the output image should follow is extracted from a pre-trained model that inturn was trained against "winged drones with sky background".
    - Embedding created was by feeding the image of lightning sky against this pre-trained model.
    - Hence, image generated will have something representing "lightning sky" effect in them.

- For Training details refer below colab notebook locations:
    - File : https://github.com/anilbhatt1/Deep_Learning_EVA8_Phase1/blob/master/S14_Stable_Diffusion/S14_Stable_Diffusion_V1.ipynb -> This is the initial notebook that uses https://huggingface.co/sd-concepts-library/birb-style
    - File : https://github.com/anilbhatt1/Deep_Learning_EVA8_Phase1/blob/master/S14_Stable_Diffusion/S14_Stable_Diffusion_V2.ipynb 
        - Created 5 images that uses following styles 'anime_background_style_v2', 'birb', 'depthmap', 'gta5_artwork', 'midjourney'
        - Styles were downloaded from https://huggingface.co/sd-concepts-library
        - For same seed and styles, generated another 5 set of images to add lightning effect to the images by adding guidance via pattern loss (refer pattern_loss in the ipynb notebook)

- Pattern Loss is as follows:
```python
def pattern_loss(images, pattern):
    """
    This function calculates the pattern loss between the output image and the desired pattern.

    Parameters:
    images (torch.Tensor): The output image generated by the Huggingface model.
    pattern (torch.Tensor): The desired pattern that the output image should follow. This is extracted from a pre-trained model in above steps.

    Returns:
    torch.Tensor: The pattern loss between the output image and the desired pattern.
    """
    # Calculate the absolute difference between the model predicetd image and the pattern extracted from pre-trained model(above step).
    diff = torch.abs(images - pattern)
    # Sum the difference over all channels and pixels.
    loss = torch.sum(diff)
    return loss

- Images created for different styles without any loss guidance
